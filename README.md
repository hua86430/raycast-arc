# Arc

Search and quickly navigate your [Arc](https://arc.net) browser's history and open tabs. You can open recent tabs in Arc or Little Arc as well as copy websites to quickly share them.

## Features

- **Improved Search**: Supports fuzzy search with space-separated keywords (e.g., "leo prod" matches tabs containing both terms in title, URL, or folder path).
- **Folder Path Integration**: Search results include the sidebar folder path for saved tabs, making it easier to locate specific items in complex hierarchies.
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved an issue with the official Raycast Arc extension where opening tabs sometimes failed or behaved unexpectedly.
